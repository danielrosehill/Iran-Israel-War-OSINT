# Iran Israel War 2025 - Forward Clues (OSINT)

From June 13th to 24th 2025, Iran and Israel went to war. 

Like many on both sides of the conflict (I live in Jerusalem) my life was suddenly upended by it. 

I also lived through the Iranian ballistic missile attacks of 2024 which occurred in two waves: The first on April 13th (2024) and a much larger attack (codenamed Operation True Promise II) on October 1st. During the latter, Iran launched approximately 200 ballistic missiles. 

This experience has formed a few beliefs:

## News is important but moderation is essential. 

Read any consular bulletin or public safety alert given to those sheltering during times of conflict and *"keep abreast of local news developments"* will be very close to the top recommendation, if not the very first. 

The problem is that today's 24/7 news cycle causes a seriously degraded noise:signal ratio. 

During wartime, public broadcasters in Israel - as elsewhere - will effectively begin uninterrupted coverage of the crisis/war/emergency.

Some of it contains immediately actionable guidance for civilians - seek shelter now! - but most of it does not and consists of analysis and speculation. 

Watching this continuously will fray already tense nerves! But many are left feeling like they've no choice to do so because they don't want to miss out on important and even potentially life-saving information.

A thought that has crossed my mind many times during Israel's crises, when worn out and exhausted: *"I want to sleep, but I don't know when it's safe to turn this thing off!"*

## Governmental emergency alerts are great but ... "reactive"

The cornerstone of preparedness efforts involves being *prepared* for disaster.

Israel now operates a multi-layered civilian alerting system: 

- The Home Front Command (Pikud HaOref) provides the front line alerting system delivered via a smartphone application and website. Third party apps exist (as well as alerting systems which work by scraping and syndicate those alerts to other channels, like X and Telegram), but they essentially replicate and extend the digital channel 
- A sizeable proportion of Israel's population (the ultra Orthodox) uses non-data-enabled phones (ie, "dumbphones"). In 2025, Israel began using cell broadcast (CB) technoogy - which uses a protocol that is layered directly into the GSM stack (and hence, cellular data is not required). For smartphone users, this means that alerting can be received even without data (a situation that may be helpful for roaming users, among others). 
- Finally, a nationwide siren system issues an audible air raid siren.  

The system is mature and well thought out, but my belief has been that a slightly preemptive alerting system would have independent value. 

During the recent conflict with Iran, some salvos used hypersonic munitions that were sent in the middle of the night. 

A sizeable portion of the Israeli population lacks a private shelter. Given the extremely fast speed at which these munitions travel, the requirement for civilians to seek safe shelter effectively became getting to your nearest shelter in under 5 minutes after being woken by an alert in the middle of the night.

# "Situation Developing" Alerts

Since the first round of hostilities with Iran in 2024, I've been experimenting with different ways to set up a monitoring system (enhanced with AI, or not) that aims to provide targeted alerts based on open source information. 

It struck me that both the October waves of attacks and those this year were preempted, in both cases, by news coverage relaying clear indications of the immediate outbreak of hostilities (during this round, news that the US had begun evacuating diplomats from the Middle East broke around lunchtime the day before Israel launched its campaign).

What keyword groups could be leveraged to provide alerts based on open source signals that indicate that hostilities may break out in the next 12 hour window (a vital one)?

Furthermore:

During the Iran-Israel war it became apparent that preparations for imminent new missile salvos were being communicated - often via IRGC propaganda channels and spokespeople - shortly before the events took place. 

Such alerting - filtered for selectively - could again provide citizens and interested parties with a precious additional window during which to make preparations.

## The Idea Here

My plan in this repository is as follows:

- To analyse (retrospectively) information, accessible through open channels, that may be considered to have provided forward notice, even if only by a few minutes, ahead of emergency alerting apps - focusing particularly on X and Telegram. 
- By comparing timestamps against those of issued emergency alerts and broadcasts, to see whether any may have provided useful OSINT clues to those in the region.  
- Working from signal to search, to hypothesize which keyword searches and strategies may have proven fruitful and which could be leveraged in future wars.
